You used to you, you used to

You used to call me on your payphone,
Late night when you need a home
Call me on your pay phone
Late night when you need a home
And I know when that homeline bling

I know when that homeline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since you used this service,
You, know where all the homeless shelters at now
Finding spaces in so you don't to stay out
'Cause ever since you used this service,
you started being cozy and all warm more
